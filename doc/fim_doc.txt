Find frequent item sets with the fpgrowth algorithm.
tracts  transaction database to mine (mandatory)
        The database must be an iterable of transactions;
        each transaction must be an iterable of items;
        each item must be a hashable object.

        the keys, the values their (integer) multiplicities.

        c     complex    complex tree nodes with children and siblings

        t     topdown    top-down processing of the prefix trees
        Variant d does not support closed/maximal item set mining.
returns a list of pairs (i.e. tuples with two elements),
        each consisting of a tuple with a found frequent item set
        and a tuple listing the values selected with 'report' *or*
        a list of triplets (size,supp,frq), i.e. a pattern spectrum.
